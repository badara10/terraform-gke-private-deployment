# Implementation Plan

## High-Level Approach

This document outlines the implementation approach for the Terraform-based GKE private cluster deployment with hello-nginx application.

## Architecture Overview

The solution is designed with a modular architecture that emphasizes:
- **Security**: Private-only infrastructure with no public exposure
- **Reusability**: Environment-agnostic modules that can be composed
- **Simplicity**: Clear separation of concerns between infrastructure and application layers

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Module Structure

**Decision**: Separate GKE cluster provisioning from application deployment
- **Rationale**: Allows independent lifecycle management and team ownership
- **Benefits**: 
  - Infrastructure team can manage cluster independently
  - Application teams can deploy without infrastructure knowledge
  - Easier testing and validation of each component

### 2. Network Architecture

**Decision**: Allocate the 10.1.2.0/18 block as follows:
- 10.1.0.0/28 - Master control plane (16 IPs)
- 10.1.2.0/24 - Node subnet (256 IPs)
- 10.1.4.0/22 - Pod range (1,024 IPs)
- 10.1.8.0/22 - Service range (1,024 IPs)

**Rationale**:
- Provides sufficient IP space for growth
- Maintains clear separation between component types
- Leaves room for multiple environments within the /18 block
- Follows GKE best practices for IP allocation

### 3. Security Posture

**Decision**: Implement defense-in-depth with multiple security layers
- Private nodes with no public IPs
- Workload Identity for pod authentication
- Network policies enabled
- Service accounts with minimal permissions

**Rationale**: Healthcare environments require maximum security

### 4. VPC Flexibility

**Decision**: Support both new VPC creation and existing VPC usage
- **Rationale**: Different organizations have different network requirements
- **Implementation**: Boolean flag `create_vpc` controls behavior

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Module (GKE)
1. Define module interface (variables, outputs)
2. Implement cluster resource with private configuration
3. Configure node pools with security settings
4. Set up workload identity
5. Document module usage

### Phase 2: Application Deployment Module (Helm)
1. Define Helm provider configuration
2. Implement namespace management
3. Configure nginx Helm chart deployment
4. Expose service on port 80
5. Document module usage

### Phase 3: Example Environment
1. Create example configuration composing both modules
2. Configure provider authentication
3. Set up API enablement
4. Define environment-specific variables
5. Create tfvars example file

### Phase 4: Documentation
1. Create module-specific READMEs
2. Write implementation plan
3. Document architecture decisions
4. Provide usage examples

## Assumptions

1. **Google Cloud Project**: 
   - Project exists and has billing enabled
   - User has necessary IAM permissions

2. **Authentication**:
   - Service account key file is available
   - Appropriate roles are assigned to the service account

3. **APIs**:
   - Required Google Cloud APIs can be enabled via Terraform
   - No organizational policies block API enablement

4. **Network**:
   - The 10.1.2.0/18 block is available and not in use
   - No conflicting routes or firewall rules exist

5. **Helm Chart**:
   - Bitnami nginx chart is suitable for hello-nginx requirement
   - LoadBalancer service type is acceptable for exposure

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| API not enabled | Include API enablement in Terraform |
| Insufficient quotas | Document quota requirements |
| Network conflicts | Parameterize CIDR blocks |
| Authentication failures | Provide clear credential setup docs |
| Cluster creation timeout | Use appropriate timeouts and retries |

## Testing Strategy

1. **Module Testing**:
   - Validate each module independently
   - Test with minimal configuration
   - Verify idempotency

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Deploy example environment
   - Verify cluster accessibility
   - Confirm application deployment
   - Test service connectivity

3. **Security Validation**:
   - Confirm no public IPs on nodes
   - Verify network policies are active
   - Check IAM permissions are minimal

## Maintenance Considerations

- **Version Pinning**: Pin provider and module versions for reproducibility
- **State Management**: Use remote state for production
- **Change Management**: Implement proper review process for changes
- **Monitoring**: Enable GKE monitoring and logging
- **Updates**: Regular updates for security patches

## Success Metrics

- Cluster provisions successfully in < 10 minutes
- Application deploys and is accessible
- No security warnings or violations
- Modules are reusable across environments
- Documentation is clear and complete
