# Free Tier Limits Reference:
# - Compute Engine: 744 hours/month of e2-micro instance

# - GKE: Management fee waived for one zonal cluster
#
# Monthly Cost Estimate with these settings:
# - GKE Management: $0 (first cluster free)
# - 2x e2-micro preemptible: ~$3-4/month
# - 40 GB standard disk: ~$1.60/month
# - Total: ~$5-6/month (mostly covered by free tier credits)
